Origin:		ROC (Rochester)
Desination:	DCA (Washington)
Scenario:	My business keeps me on the go. I need to meet with a client in D.C and be back in town early the next day to discuss a new contract. Specifically, I need to fly out very early, Tuesday, January 10, arriving no later than noon, and leave sometime after 6 PM that same day so I can be my meeting back in Rochester at 9 AM sharp. Price doesn't matter much as the business is more important than the airfare.
