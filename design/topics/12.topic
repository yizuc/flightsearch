Origin:		FLG (Flagstaff)
Desination:	ICT (Wichita)
Scenario:	I need to attend a 3-day meeting in Wichita from Wednesday, January 25, through Friday, January 27. Unfortunately, my employer doesn't allow me to charge time over the weekend, so any extra time in Wichita Saturday, January 28, is a waste. I don't have to pay for the ticket, of course.
Income:		$100,000+
Gender:		Male
Age:		60-64
