Origin:		SNA (Santa Ana)
Desination:	EWR (Newark)
Scenario:	I need to attend a week-long business meeting in Newark, and the timing on the way back is tight. I'll fly out Sunday, March 4 to make the early morning Monday meeting, which is fine. I can return on a flight leaving as early as 10 am on the last day (Friday, March 9), which is good, because I have some personal matters to attend to Saturday, March 10 back in Santa Ana that will take most of the day. My boss will pay for the ticket.
