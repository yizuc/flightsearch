Scenario:	I'm going to a week-long meeting in Tampa Bay, flying out Sunday, March 11 and returning Sunday, March 18. Since the meeting ends Friday, March 16 at 5 pm, I'm going to fly my family out afterwards so we can visit the amusement parks in the area. Work will pay for my ticket, but not those for my family, obviously. (Assume the family returns on the same flight and pays the same price).
