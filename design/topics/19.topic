Scenario:	My millionaire uncle has passed away. I'm headed out there, along with other family members, to go through his estate Friday, January 6 through Saturday, January 7. I'm going to have to take time off of work for this, so the shorter the trip is, the better. Cost of the ticket will come out of my pocket.
