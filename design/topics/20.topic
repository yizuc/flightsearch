Desination:	PHF (Newport News)
Scenario:	I'm helping Aunt Edna move into a care facility from Saturday, March 17 through Tuesday, March 20. I'm going there Friday, March 16 and coming back Wednesday, March 21. I want to make sure she's has what she needs but I also don't want to take too much time off work, so the shorter my trip is, the better. I'll also need to pay for the ticket myself.
