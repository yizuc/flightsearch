Origin:		BWI (Baltimore)
Desination:	SFO (San Francisco)
Scenario:	I need to drop some relatives off at the airport by 11 AM on December 30, and catch a flight myself that same day to go to San Francisco to celebrate the New Year. (I can drop them off early if my flight leaves before 11 AM, though it's not ideal.) I've got ten days for the trip, including travel time, and will pay for the ticket myself.
